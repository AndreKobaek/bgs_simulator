# Deathrattles
Deathrattle ordering:
Triggered in the order that the minions die
if two minions (of opposing warbands) die at the same time it is random which procs first
If it's multiple on the same side, they proc from left to right


Combat steps:
Pre-attack effects (Prestor's, Pirates) -> post death/
Pre-defend effects (Arm + Champ)
Attack + Defense simultaneous

Stack of buffs - 
    post divine-shield
    post damage
    post death

Deathrattles (random order for minions dead simultanous)
New deathrattles in order of death

Questions: 
Does a Champion of Y'sharj grow if a friendly taunt is shot down by a Prestor's?
Does a Mecherel gain DS before it gets shot by a enemy juggler (after annoy-o-tron vs ickyimp)
If a minion has multiple deathrattles and a baron is present, do all the deathrattles get triggered and then repeated once or twice, or does the first deathrattle get triggered two to three times and then the next?
